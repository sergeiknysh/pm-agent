# Documentation Rules

You are working on the PM-as-Files project.
Documentation is located in `pm/docs/`.

## Structure
- Always update `pm/docs/README.md` when adding new doc files.
- Keep the table of contents in `pm/docs/README.md` up to date.
- Use relative links: `[Concept](./concept.md)`.

## Content Style
- Use concise Markdown.
- Headers: H1 for title, H2 for major sections.
- Code blocks: always specify language (ts, bash, json).

## Project Context
- **Root**: `pm-as-files` (application code: src/, web/, scripts/).
- **Data**: `pm/` (user content: tasks, projects, inbox.md).
- **Docs**: `pm/docs/` (architecture & specs).
